# HakLand.github.io
Main site for HackLand - the Auckland Hackspace

To add a project or tool, just add a file to the `projects/_posts` or `tools/_posts` directory and wait a couple of minutes for GitHub to rebuild the site.
The files are in Markdown format which is much easier to use than HTML.
Use one of the existing posts as a template.

The main pages are all Markdown (`.md`) files in the root directory.
